# Analysis-of-Flight-Cancellations-and-Delays-in-2015
The problem we have decided to solve is the analysis of the flight cancellations and delays data. With the advent of globalization, it has become an increasing priority to have not only efficient but safe travel across the globe. The goal of our project is to provide queries that would not only allow passengers to learn what times and companies incur the highest chance of delay, but can allow the airlines to further break down delay data to see where improvements at certain airports or at certain parts of planes travel can be made to improve performance and therefore reduce cost.
